# python-vectorclocksystem
A program implementing vectors as logical clocks between server and client nodes.
The program has three clients client,client2 and client3 who listen from different ports.
The Server gets data from the clients and increment its clock by one and send an average of the clocks from the clients to set the time for all clients to be the same
#future recommendations 
client being able to send message to other clients and getting their time differences.
